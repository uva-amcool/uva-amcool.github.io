<p style='text-align: justify;'>Dr Soja-Wozniak and the UvA team will be studying which colors are available for photosynthesis on Earth under sea ice and on exoplanets. The colors available for photosynthesis depend on the incident irradiance spectra emitted by star(s), which are known to vary with their surface temperature (e.g., from hot blue giants to cool red dwarfs). In addition, the colors available for photosynthesis depend strongly on absorption spectra of the atmospheres and the oceans of the planets harboring these organisms.</p>
