<p style='text-align: justify;'> Many processes that occur in nature feature complex reaction networks, such as in natural  oils and resins, and metabolic reactions.
The challenge of studying such system originates in the heterogeneity of the reaction pathways. 
In our research, we tackle this problem with computational modeling using tools from network science. The topics of our current research include evolution of metabolism and origin of life.</p>
